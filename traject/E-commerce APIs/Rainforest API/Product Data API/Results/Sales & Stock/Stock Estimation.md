**Products that Require Login**  
For some ASINs Amazon will require the user to be logged in to their Amazon account to add the product to the cart.  
  
In these instances Rainforest will be unable to provide stock estimation data. You can determine whether this is the case by inspecting the `stock_estimation.requires_login = true` property of the response.

Rainforest API returns the following properties for Stock Estimation requests:
