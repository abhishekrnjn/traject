Offers Results
--------------

When making a request with the `type` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/offers) set to `type=offers` Rainforest API will return all Seller Offers for the product specified in either the `asin` and `amazon_domain` parameters or the `url` parameter.

Offers are retrieved from the offers listing popup window for a single product on Amazon.

Note that the buybox-winner offer is always pinned to the top of the offers listing popup window, above the 'other offers'. Rainforest will append the buybox winner offer to the top of the `offers` array when `page=1`.

**Paginating Offers Results**  
Amazon returns 10 offers per page. To request more offers issue additional requests incrementing the `page` [parameter](/docs/product-data-api/parameters/offers).
